welcome: Welcome to memory blast. I'm going to say numbers for you to repeat. What level would you like to start at?
welcome_repromt: Please say a level between one and ten to begin.

round: Level {{ lvl }} . Can you repeat the numbers {{ numbers|join(", ") }} ?

win: Good job!

lose: Sorry, that's the wrong answer!

goodbye: Thanks for playing memory blast. Goodbye!

help: To play, repeat the numbers I read out to you. When you correctly repeat the numbers, the difficulty increases. When you are incorrect, the difficulty decreases. You may stop at anytime by saying stop. What level would you like to start at?
